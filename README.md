## About The Project

![image](https://github.com/Malay-dev/Prism_URL_Typo_Corr/assets/91375797/adf70196-6fb8-4567-8744-8ce264cc6463)

A web application built using Flask a Python web framework designed to correct and retrieve search results for a given URL based on a specified location. Users can input a URL and select a location from a list triggering a backend process that scrapes search engine results relevant to that URL and location. The application utilizes a typo correction mechanism to refine the URL if any typos or inaccuracies are detected.

Leveraging a fuzzy Levenshtein distance algorithm, the application corrects any detected typos or inaccuracies in the URL input by users.
